## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript
- Document Object Model
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### What I learned

By doing this project I revised all the things I learned about the Document Object Model. Although, I somehow encounter some confusion. But slowly I'm getting rid of those.

### Continued Development

From now on, I will try to build some new projects on Vanilla JS.
