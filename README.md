## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript
- Document Object Model
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### What I learned

By doing this project I revised all the things I learned about the Document Object Model. I added a **remove button** for each item. Although, I tried to add a **undo** button as well but it's kind of buggy. Here is the code snippet below:

### Continued Development

From now on, I will try to build some new projects on Vanilla JS.
